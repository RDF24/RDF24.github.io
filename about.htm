		<div id='about'>
			<p>Hello! Thanks for taking the time to learn a little about me. As I'm sure you can already tell I enjoy the 'geekier' side of pop culture. I began teaching myself web development as a hobby and now I hope to turn it into a career. I am a very self-motivated person and thrive in remote and online work environments. I have knowledge and experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, CSS Grid and APIs. I am constantly looking to expand my knowledge.

				<br/> While you are here please take the time to look over my portfolio. All of my projects are posted on CodePen but the ones highlighted in my portfolio are my favorites. See you, Space Cowboy...</p>
